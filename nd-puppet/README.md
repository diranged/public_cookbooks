# nd-puppet: Puppet Bootstrapping Cookbook

This cookbook is available at [https://github.com/nextdoor/public_cookbooks](https://github.com/nextdoor/public_cookbooks).

This cookbook installs and configures Puppet on a server, then runs it
a configured number of times looking for a safe (0) exit code.

# Requirements

Requires a virtual machine from a RightScale managed RightImage.
Puppet is installed and configured under the root user for a host.

 * Cookbook: [rightscale](https://github.com/rightscale/rightscale_cookbooks/tree/master/cookbooks/rightscale)

# Usage

Usage of this recipe requires that you have a Puppet Policy-based autosigning
script in place on your Puppet master that can validate the CSR information
supplied.

[Puppet 3.4 Policy-based Auto Signing](http://docs.puppetlabs.com/puppet/3/reference/release_notes.html#policy-based-certificate-autosigning)

# Attributes

These are settings used in recipes and tempaltes. Default values are noted.

Note: Only "internal" cookbook attributes are described here. Descriptions of
attributes which have inputs can be found in the metadata.rb file.

## Puppet installation attributes

* `node[:'nd-puppet'][:default][:version]` - The Puppet version to install.

## Puppet configuration attributes

* `node[:'nd-puppet'][:config][:facts]` - Array of custom key=value puppet facts.
* `node[:'nd-puppet'][:config][:puppet_node]` - The Puppet node name.
  (default: $hostname)
* `node[:'nd-puppet'][:config][:node_name]` - Puppet Option: node\_name.
  (default: node\_name)
* `node[:'nd-puppet'][:config][:node_name_fact]` - Puppet Option: node\_name\_fact.
  (default: puppet\_node)
* `node[:'nd-puppet'][:config][:challenge_password]` - Optional string passed to the
  puppet master as a CSR Attribute named challengePassword.

# Puppet Facts

This cookbook creates a */etc/facter/facts.d/nd-puppet.txt* fact file which
takes advantage of [Facters 1.7 release](http://puppetlabs.com/blog/facter-1-7-introduces-external-facts)
to create custom facts that can be used by your Puppet Master during
compilation of the puppet manifest. The `nd-puppet::config` recipe writes
this file with a hard-set of Puppet facts (listed below) as well as any custom
facts passed into the `node[:'nd-puppet'][:config][:facts]` server input.

## Default Facts

 * `puppet_node` - Value from `node[:'nd-puppet'][:config][:puppet_node]`
 * `puppet_environment` - Value from `node[:'nd-puppet'][:config][:puppet_environment]`

## Custom Facts

The `node[:'nd-puppet'][:config][:facts]` server input allows you to specify
a set of key=value pairs (comma separated) that will be written out to the
*/etc/facter/facts.d/nd-puppet.txt* file on separated lines. This allows you
to write out any custom facts that your Puppet Manifests may need.

# Recipes

## `nd-puppet::default`

Installs, configures and executes Puppet. Meta-recipe that includes:

* `nd-puppet::install`
* `nd-puppet::config`
* `nd-puppet::run`

## `nd-puppet::install`

Ensures that the requested Puppet version is installed.

## `nd-puppet::config`

Configures the custom puppet facts and configures puppet for its first run.

## `nd-puppet::clean`

Wipes out the existing configured Puppet state created by the nd-puppet:config
class. This is useful for prepping a machine for imaging.
